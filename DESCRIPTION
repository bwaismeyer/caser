Description: The caser package has a very simple purpose: Help you convert
    strings - including vectors of strings such as dataframe column names - to a
    target naming/formatting convention. The package takes advantage of the fact
    that most naming and formatting conventions tinker with two string
    properties: the separator between words and the word capitalization rules.
    By specifying a separator style and a capitilization style, you can quickly
    flip strings among the most common naming/formatting conventions (or come up
    with your own fancy pants ones).
